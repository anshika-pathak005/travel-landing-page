# Travel Landing Page ✈️  

A modern travel website landing page built with HTML and CSS, fully responsive across devices. This was one of my first responsive projects — where I learned how layouts adapt to different screen sizes and how real websites structure their sections.  

## Overview 🌍  
This project showcases a clean, structured landing page with sections for destinations, hotels, activities, about us, and contact. It was an early experiment in building layouts that look great on desktops, tablets, and mobiles without breaking.  

## Features 🚀  
- Fully responsive design — works across all screen sizes.  
- Hero section with CTA button to engage users instantly.  
- Destinations, Hotels, and Activities sections using grid layouts.  
- About Us section featuring team members.  
- Contact form with styled inputs and buttons.  
- Social media footer with linked icons.  
- Hover effects and smooth transitions for interactivity.  
- Clean typography and consistent spacing for a professional feel.
