# Travel Landing Page ✈️  

A modern travel website landing page built with HTML and CSS, fully responsive across devices. This was one of my first responsive projects — where I learned how layouts adapt to different screen sizes and how real websites structure their sections.  

## Features 🚀  
- Fully responsive design — works across all screen sizes.  
- Hero section with CTA button to engage users instantly.  
- Destinations, Hotels, and Activities sections using grid layouts.  
- About Us section featuring team members.  
- Contact form with styled inputs and buttons.
